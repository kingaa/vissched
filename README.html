  <h2>vissched: Visit-Day Scheduler</h2>

  <p>This tool uses simulated annealing for solving a complicated
  scheduling problem. It is assumed that <em>M</em> visitors wish
  to meet with <em>N</em> residents. There are <em>K</em>
  time-slots available. Each resident may or may not be available
  during any given time-slot. Each visitor wishes to meet with a
  different subset of residents but does not care in which order
  the meetings are to be held. Each visitor attaches a degree of
  importance, or weight, to each resident, indicative of the desire
  the visitor has to meet with the resident. Thus a weight of 1
  indicates a very strong desire, a weight of 0.5 a somewhat
  less-strong desire, and a weight of 0, complete indifference.</p>

  <p>The algorithm attempts to find a schedule such that</p>

  <ol>
    <li>every visitor is meeting with someone during every
    time-slot,</li>

    <li>every visitor meets with every resident to which they have
    attached a weight of 1, and</li>

    <li>very few meetings are scheduled where more than one visitor
    meets with a resident at one time.</li>
  </ol>This is accomplished by assigning a measure of desirability,
  "goodness", to each possible schedule and then maximizing the
  goodness over the space of possible schedules by means of
  simulated annealing.

  <p>A template input file (in CSV format) is available <a href=
  "input.csv">here</a>. For details of the algorithm, which
  contains some adjustable parameters, consult the C code in file
  <a href="vissched.c">vissched.c</a>. Kindly direct questions, bug
  reports, suggestions for improvements, and requests for the
  source code to the author, Aaron King &lt;kingaa at umich dot edu&gt;.</p>
